üö¢ Titanic Survival Prediction Project in Python üöÄ

Implemented a Titanic survival prediction model using Python! üêç In this project, I used the popular machine learning library, scikit-learn, to build a predictive model based on the Titanic dataset.

1. Data Exploration:

Explored the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.

2. Feature Engineering:

Engineered new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
Utilized techniques like one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

3. Model Selection:

Experimented with various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
Used cross-validation to assess and compare model performance.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tuned model parameters for optimal performance using techniques like Grid Search.

5. Evaluation Metrics:

Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its effectiveness.

6. Visualization:

Created insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the data and model results.


Findings:
    
In the Titanic dataset, 36.36% of passengers survived, while 63.64% did not survive. 
All females survived, whereas none of the males survived. A significant number of passengers in classes 3 and 2 did not survive. 
Passengers without siblings/spouses or parents/children aboard had lower chances of survival. 
Those embarking from Queenstown had a higher likelihood of survival, while those embarking from Southampton had lower chances.
